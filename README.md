MATERIALHUB is a comprehensive and user-friendly web application designed to revolutionize the construction industry by providing access to a vast array of building materials such as rocks, sand, clay, cement, and more. This innovative platform harnesses the power of technology to provide a centralized hub where builders, architects, and homeowners can streamline their decision-making process and enhance the quality of their construction projects.
The MATERIALHUB project consists of four main modules: Admin, Clients, Dealers, and Drivers. Each module offers a range of functionalities tailored to their specific roles and responsibilities.
Administrators play a crucial role in managing the system. They have the ability to oversee registrations, verify and approve listings, update database information, monitor user activity, and facilitate communication between all parties involved.
Dealers, comprising manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, are pivotal in ensuring the availability and accessibility of building materials. They can register themselves and await approval from the admin, list their materials with detailed descriptions and specifications, update material availability and pricing, engage in direct communication with clients, and receive feedback to improve their offerings.
Clients, representing builders, contractors, architects, and homeowners, are the primary beneficiaries of MATERIALHUB. They can register, log in, and access a wealth of building material information. Clients can browse through the database of materials, compare different options based on their requirements, view detailed specifications and pricing, place orders, and track deliveries.
Drivers, as an integral part of the MATERIALHUB ecosystem, facilitate the delivery of materials from dealers to clients. They have access to delivery schedules, client details and payments.
